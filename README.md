# Milestone 1: A site to promote the monkees band.

The project is based on promoting a band to showcase HTML and CSS skills learned so far as part of the code institute online diploma. In this project I have assumed that 
The Monkees are a current band and not from the 60's although the site and styling is 60s themed. 

## UX

The project has been designed with the end user in mind.  The end user being members of the public who eith wish to purchase tickets or book the band for a private event.
With this in mind the flow of the site has been created in a traditional still with clear navigation and a large 'call to action' button (Get Tickect) place in the header
of the home screen.  This call to action button occupies prime real estate in order to drive ticket sales and contains a hover effect to drive the 'click through rate' and 
increase conversions.  This aspect of the site recognises its commercial nature whilst enhancing the user experience by making it easy to acquire tickets within a couple of 
clicks.

A user may wish to perform the following actions:

* reach out to the band via social media.
* subscribe to regular updates.
* book tickets via the site.
* contact the band via the contact form.
* contact the band via more traditional means (post/phone/email)

The site provides all of these options to the end user and is very easy to utilise and navigate.

As mentioned the site is intentionally styled in a bespoke 60's theme with the font style also being reflective of the design principles.  The intention is to create a 
visually appealing fun site with engaging animation and original ideas such as the spinning disks in the music section to enhance the user experience.

# Wireframes for this project are available here https://github.com/JayPeaa/milestone1final/blob/master/Milestone1.pdf

# Features

The main features of the site are:

* Ticket bookings
* Email subsciption as a means to build mailing lists as part of a marketing strategy
* Social Media for marketing and engagement purposes
* Contact Form for ease of communication
* Animation to enhance user experience, drive engagement, increase click-throuh and drive conversions and sales

## Future development

Future features may include the use og a google maps API for each of the venues in the tour section for example which can be used in conjunction with google
Maps for navigation and additional UX benefits.

# Testing

Testing has been conducted using google dev tools. Thourough testing in all the various mobile devices alonge with general responsiveness (responsive mode) has concluded
that this site works well in all modern day browsers and mobile devices. As part of the testing process each page has been reviewed systematically to ensure all links
work as intended and the pages display correctly.  

This testing has confirmed that users will be able to utilise the site as intended, on any device to achieve their goals whilst enjoying the experience and customer journey.

At this state any forms are front end only in line with the project scope and currently do not function. These forms have only been tested for responsiveness and 
field qualities (e.g. Place holder text appears, Propmt for required fields are correctly displayed) at this stage.

All user forms display correctly and as intended on various displays / devices.

# Deployment

Throught the projects regular git commits were made to ensure any working files were backed up. In excess of 20 commits have been loged on the main branch in gitHub.
The progect has been succesfully deployed on gitHub pages.  There is only one mainbranch in gitHub for this project.

AWS cloud9 has been used throughout this project as the IDE of choice.  

# File Structure

The project has been organised in the following structure:

* milestone1final (Project Folder)
* assets (folder)
    * vendor (folder)
        * audio (folder)
        * images (folder)
